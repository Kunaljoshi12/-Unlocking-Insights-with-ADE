#T5 Model 
A news_summary dataset can be used to train a pre-trained T5 model for text summarization. The model is trained to generate concise summaries from longer text inputs. We can utilize the headline and text columns of the dataset, treating the text as input and the headline as the desired output. Once trained, this model can produce summaries for new text inputs.
